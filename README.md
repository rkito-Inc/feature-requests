# 📢 Contributing Feedback, Feature Requests & Technical Discussions

This repository serves as the central place for engineering stakeholders—including developers, architects, tech leads, engineering managers, and open-source maintainers—to collaborate on feature requests, technical improvements, and overall product direction.

Your input directly shapes the roadmap. We encourage structured, high-quality contributions through **Issues** and **Discussions**.

---

## 🟢 1. Submitting a New Issue

Use **Issues** for actionable, trackable work items such as:

- ✨ Feature requests  
- 🧩 Architectural or design enhancements  
- 🐞 Bug reports  
- ⚙️ Developer experience improvements  
- 📘 Documentation updates  
- 🔧 Engineering infrastructure suggestions  

👉 **Create a new issue:**  
**https://github.com/rkito-Inc/feature-requests/issues/new/choose**

### Issue Submission Guidelines
1. Navigate to the Issues page:  
   https://github.com/rkito-Inc/feature-requests/issues
2. Select **New issue**
3. Choose a relevant template (Feature Request, Bug Report, Enhancement, etc.)
4. Provide detailed context, including:
   - Problem statement  
   - Proposed solution or design considerations  
   - Impact on architecture, performance, or workflows  
   - Dependencies or related components  
5. Submit for review

Issues allow us to track prioritization, planning, and long-term maintenance.

## 💬 2. Using the Discussion Board

Use **Discussions** for open-ended, exploratory, or high-level conversations, including:

- 💡 Early-stage ideation  
- 🔍 Evaluation of trade-offs and design patterns  
- ❓ Technical Q&A  
- 🗺️ Roadmap input  
- 🧠 Architecture brainstorming before committing to an issue  

👉 **Join the discussions:**  
**https://github.com/rkito-Inc/feature-requests/discussions**

### How to Participate
1. Open the Discussions tab  
2. Select a topic category (Ideas, Architecture, Q&A, General, etc.)
3. Start a new thread or contribute to an existing conversation  
4. Share insights, designs, diagrams, or best practices

Discussions help validate ideas before they become actionable issues.
